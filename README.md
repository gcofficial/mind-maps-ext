The clear way to share complex information. Mind maps is a collaborative tool that helps you make sense of complex things.
Mind maps are useful for anyone to plan, take notes, visualise information, brainstorm, solve problems, study, and share information (to name just a few). There's really no limit to their uses! Everyone who values visual thinking, in business, education, or just in their personal life can find mind maps useful to organise information.
